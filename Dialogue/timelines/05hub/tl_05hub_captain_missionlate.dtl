captain (Captain-upset-closed): {mc_code} I'm very disappointed in you.
captain (Captain-upset-open): Keep your attitude that way and you will never level up in the hierarchy.
- "Where is {navigator1_name}? Why do I have a new navigator?"
	captain (Captain-upset-open): I'm not at liberty to say. I apologize.
	captain (Captain-smile-close): Warden is our best navigator, I through matching the two of you would benefit your assignment.
	- "I don't care about Warden, I want {navigator1_name} back!"
		captain (Captain-upset-closed): Watch your tone! Remember who you are talking to!
		captain (Captain-upset-open): {navigator1_name} is no longer with us. The sooner you accommodate with this information the better.
		- "I don't understand, we just celebrated for my code name yesterday, what happened?"
			captain (Captain-upset-open): *raising voice* End of discussion, worker!
		- I apologize, Sir. It wonâ€™t happen again.
			captain (Captain-upset-closed): I hope so!
	- "Okay, I'll try to get along I guess ..."

captain (Captain-upset-closed): I have a meeting with management today, I don't have any more time for you. 
captain (Captain-upset-open): Take those credits and go grab a coffee, I want your mission report on my desk before the end of my meeting.
captain (Captain-upset-closed): I don't want to see your face until then.
