"navigator 1": Good morning sailor ! How are you doing ?
"navigator 1": Today's gonna be a bumpy ride, we have a lot of rain in the area. Peoples are usually ... Hum ... Irritable, when the weather is bad. It will have an impact in the ethersea.
"navigator 1": According to protocol, and I quote \: "Staying an extended period of time in the ethersea during a weather event put your heath and sanity at a major risk."
"navigator 1": "As a result, the allocated time for operation will be significantly reduced. Focus on the mission, do not waste time, keep your timer in your field of view and do not miss your return window." End quote ...
"navigator 1": Can you belive that ? Ehr. Anyway, do your best. I'm sending you the ping.
